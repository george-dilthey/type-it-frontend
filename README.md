# TypeIt

TypeIt is a simple typing game to see how many words you can type accurately in 60 seconds.

## Instructions

Type "START" to start the game. Type the words as quickly as possible, without messing up. Each typo will result in an "X" and you only get 5 mistakes per game.

At the end of the game, if you haven't created an account, you can do so then with just a username. You can also create an account from the homepage by typing "ACCOUNT". You can also type "SCORES" to see the all-time leaderboard.

Enjoy!
